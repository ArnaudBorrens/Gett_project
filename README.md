For this project, we are analyzing the dataset of Gett, a Ground Transportation Management technology platform.  
Clients order taxis and the system matches them with an available driver. 
In this dataset, only rides that did not complete successfully are displayed.   
Our task is to uncover some trends in these failed orders.

We'll use the following libraries for this project:  
 -pandas  
 -matplotlib  
 -folium  
 -numpy  
 -seaborn  
 -h3  
 -geopandas  
 -shapely
